    "## Q2. Explain the difference between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Web Hosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Server Environment:** In traditional web hosting, websites or applications are hosted on a single physical server. This server is dedicated to serving the website's content and handling incoming traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resource Limitations:** The performance and resources (such as CPU, RAM, storage) of the website are limited to the capabilities of the single server. If the website experiences a sudden increase in traffic, it may lead to performance issues or downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability:** Scaling up or down in traditional hosting usually involves upgrading or downgrading to a different hosting plan. This process might require manual intervention and downtime during the migration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pricing Model:** Traditional hosting typically follows a fixed pricing model, where users pay a set amount for a specific hosting package (e.g., shared hosting, VPS hosting) regardless of actual resource usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintenance Responsibility:** The hosting provider is responsible for server maintenance, updates, and security patches. Users have limited control over the underlying infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloud Hosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Virtualized Environment:** Cloud hosting uses a virtualized infrastructure where websites and applications are hosted on a cluster of interconnected virtual servers. These virtual servers can dynamically allocate resources as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resource Scalability:** Cloud hosting offers the ability to scale resources up or down based on demand. This elasticity allows websites to handle sudden spikes in traffic without performance degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pay-as-You-Go Model:** Cloud hosting typically follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model. Users are billed based on actual resource usage, allowing for cost optimization and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Availability:** Cloud hosting often provides high availability through load balancing and redundant server configurations. If one server fails, another can take its place, reducing downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-Service and Control:** Cloud hosting platforms often offer self-service portals, allowing users to manage and configure their resources, including the ability to add or remove virtual machines, storage, and networking components.\n",
